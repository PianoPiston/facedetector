if you dont know what this project is supposed to be, then you're not supposed to be here

requirements and installation:

python 3.12, you cannot use python 3.13, set the version in vscode or something (ask chatgpt and figure it out)

pip install opencv-python mediapipe

what i did was create a folder, use pyenv to make it use 3.12, then entered the command above (while still being in that folder/directory)
good luck, i believe in you
